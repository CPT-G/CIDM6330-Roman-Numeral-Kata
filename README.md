# <p style="text-align: center;">Roman Numerals Kata Reflection</p>

The Roman Numerals Kata is a challenge to code the conversion of arabic numbers into roman numerals using Python.  In order to get there, let's explore testing.  I need to keep the test batches small to validate each portion of code before compilation.

Percival and Gregory (P&G) provide a foundation on the principles of Domain Modeling and Repository Pattern.  These two portions of the overall Model Architecture or "Roadmap" help to break a multi-layered flow of information and systems into digestible segments.  The fundamental concept they indirectly articulate is building a "test first approach" for Software Architecture.

The Domain Model is a visual representation to help conceptualize input and output components, their behavior, relationships, and defines vocabulary for common understanding.  When starting an application development, you have to know the rules, players, obstacles, mitigations, and interactions.  P&G stress the importance of testing early and often throughout development.

The Repository Pattern is the management tool used to access information from a database and route it toward the domain model.  It acts independent of the domain model and the database as a "middle-man" to mitigate data access logic from business logic.

I understand the concepts here, but fall short in the implementation of building testing code.  Often times I feel like Derek Zoolander or the Infinite Monkey Theorum with Hamlet when it comes to coding.  The limited exposure I have is from CIDM 6303 Technical Foundations in Computer Information Systems.

I can plan, coordinate, integrate, and synchronize space domain assets across warfighting functions within unified land operations to include constellation management of orbital mechanics and patterns, Satellite Authorization Access Request management, and vulnerability and explotation mitigation.  But building code is a new topic for mastery.  I'm taking this course to flesh out coding skills, determine the best practices, and orient myself to the methodology of architecture.

The P&G Model Architecture diagram makes sense to me because I am accustomed to visually digesting logic in the form of tactical network architecture from an end user radio or computer all the way to a Regional Hub Node.  See Image 2 and Image 3 below for examples of tactical network architecture.

The breakdown of the Domain Model is logical to me; you have to understand and define the operating environment before you can execute.  Virtualization, compartamentalization, and Github collaboration are all tools to help development and risk mitigation.

The Repository Pattern acts like a bridge between the data base and business logic.  In networking terms it would be similar to a switch or router for data transport.  Again, I have limited exposure to this in the form of Django.

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is brand new to me.  I've jumped into the Agile Modeling Introduction to the Diagrams of UML.  Conceptually it makes sense upon exposure, but the breakdown of where the topics are segregated will take time to understand.

I feel overwhelmed by the course material and the casual structure toward topics covered and schedule.  I have developed a plan of attack on syllabus material studying and realize understanding grows with consistent exposure, trial and error, and steadfast will to keep trying.  I felt the same way starting in CIDM 6303 and was able to grasp the concepts presented fully be the end of the semester.
